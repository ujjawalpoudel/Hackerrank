"""
Ternary Search Algorithm

You are given a sorted array of integers `arr` and a target integer `x`. Implement a function that performs 
ternary search to determine the index of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, return its index; otherwise, return -1.

Ternary search works by dividing the search space into three parts (instead of two, like binary search) 
and recursively or iteratively narrowing the search space. The time complexity of ternary search in the worst 
case is **O(logâ‚ƒ n)**.

Example:
arr = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16, 23, 38, 56, 72, 91]
x = 23
Expected Output: 5

# 1. Regular test case where the target is in the array.

# 3. Test case where the target is the last element.

# 4. Test case where the target is not in the array.

# 5. Edge case: Empty array.

# 6. Test case with only one element, where the target is present.
